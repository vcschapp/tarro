I was able to extract the JRE on Windows 10 running JDK 9.0.1 by running the
following at the Windows command prompt:

> jimage extract "%JAVA_HOME%\lib\modules"

Took a while but it worked.

All I then did was make a fake "rt.jar" by grabbing all of the classes from the
java.base module and zipping them up into a JAR. Obviously this is fake, but
since Java 9/Jigsaw has gotten rid of the concept of `rt.jar`, the steps I've
taken are a handy way to obtain a large JAR of standard classes for testing
purposes.
