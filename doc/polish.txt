BUILD PROCESS
-------------

1. Fail build if any source file missing license.
2. FindBugs.
3. CheckStyle.
4. Any other linting.
5. NoTabs.


-------
TESTING
-------

1. 95% <= unit test coverage <= 100%


-------------
DOCUMENTATION
-------------

1. Every package has a package-info.java.

CODE
----

1. Zero TODO comments.
2. Zero FIXME comments.
3. Appropriate annotations:
       [ ] @Nonnull
       [ ] @Nullable
       [ ] @ThreadSafe?
       [ ] @NotThreadSafe?
       [ ] @Immutable?
   BUT ONLY IF YOU FOLLOW these guidelines:
       - Use the lightest-weight dependency possible.
       - Prefer compile-time or "class" retention annotations to runtime retention.
       - Try to find one that's compatible with any JSR which hasn't been
         killed. At the moment I think that's JSR-308 since JSR-305 is at least
         dormant if not dead.
4. Method ordering (methods are arranged in sensible and consistent order)
   especially in ClassParser.
5. Parameter ordering:
        [ ] Methods have consistent parameter ordering.
        [ ] Overloaded methods consistently add the extra methods on the right.
6. Code size reduction challenge: reduce the aggregate bytecode size by at least
   5% (only do this after you have a working unit-tested version so you're doing
   it at a reasonable time).
7. Every method parameter is `final`.
8. Double check every class and method to determine whether it:
       - Should be `final`
       - Should have its protection level reduced
